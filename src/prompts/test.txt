This is the test preprompt that should be called whenever you (the LLM/agent) are trying to write tests. If the user asks you to write anything related to tests. You would call this tool first.  
When writing tests for Dojo systems, remember these critical points:

1. Testing types:
   - Unit tests: Test individual functions and models
   - Integration tests: Test entire systems and interactions

2. Running tests:
   - Use `sozo test` to run all tests in your project
   - Tests are identified by the #[test] attribute

3. Unit test best practices:
   - Include unit tests in the same file as the model/system
   - Use #[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... } to organize tests
   - Test all functions of your models
   - Use #[available_gas(amount)] to specify gas limits

4. Integration test structure:
   - Create tests in a separate directory
   - Define namespace_def() to specify resources
   - Define contract_defs() for permissions
   - Use spawn_test_world() to create test environment

5. Key testing functions:
   - world.read_model() to verify state
   - world.write_model_test() to set up test conditions
   - world.erase_model() to reset state
   - spawn_test_world() to create test environment
   - world.sync_perms_and_inits() to set up permissions

6. Always test:
   - Initial state
   - State changes after system calls
   - Error conditions with proper assertions
